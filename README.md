# Battleships_OOP_project

Project developed during Objected Oriented Programming classes with @Krymu. 

"The project goal is to implement a game imitating a sea battle, 
which resembles the classical Battleship game, but with several important modifications."


Evaluation criteria:
D1) proper use of inheritance (pay attention to where it should be used, and where to use delegation)
D2) abstract classes and interfaces (polymorphism, S.O.L.I.D.)
D3) two-way relationships (association / aggregation)
D4) one-to-many or many-to-many relationships (involving the use of dynamic structures)
D5) separation of the user interface, data storage and logic (programming in terms of abstraction, reverse dependencies, S.O.L.I.D.)
D6) correct use of access specifiers to access fields and methods
D7) correct distribution of responsibilities between the classes (one class - one responsibility, S.O.L.I.D.)
D8) notes on the diagram for easy understanding

What it must contain, what to look for in the implementation of the project:
I1) use of external library - check the license
I2) use of STL containers as dynamic structures
I3) dynamically allocated memory (proper management, smart pointers are welcome)
I4) where necessary, implement destructors (virtual), assignment operators and copy constructor / move constructor
I5) error handling via exceptions (in particular use of exceptions from standard library as a base class for your own exceptions)
I6) uniform style, formatting, and comments in the code (suggested is to use AStyle or similar mechanism)
I7) unit tests (for game logic)
I8) writing and reading of the state of the application from file using streams (pay attention to exception situations)

Optional features (extra points):
I9) use of algorithms available in the standard library
I10) use of facilities of C++11 standard or higher
I11) place the application classes in their own namespaces
I12) enforce the use of exceptions for operations on streams, ensure closing the stream
